      summary: |-
        Check gets the health of the specified service. If the requested service
        is unknown, the call will fail with status NOT_FOUND. If the caller does
        not specify a service name, the server should respond with its overall
        health status.
      description: |-
        Clients should set a deadline when calling Check, and can declare the
        server unhealthy if they do not receive a timely response.

        Check implementations should be idempotent and side effect free.
