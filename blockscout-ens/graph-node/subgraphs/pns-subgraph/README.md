# PNS Subgraph

This Subgraph sources events from the PNS contracts. This includes the PNS registry, the Auction Registrar, and any resolvers that are created and linked to domains. The resolvers are added through dynamic data sources. More information on all of this can be found at [The Graph Documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/developer/quick-start/).

# Example Queries

Here we have example queries, so that you don't have to type them in yourself eachtime in the graphiql playground:

```graphql
{
  domains {
    id
    labelName
    labelhash
    parent {
      id
    }
    subdomains {
      id
    }
    owner {
      id
    }
    resolver {
      id
    }
    ttl
  }
  resolvers {
    id
    address
    domain {
      id
    }
    events {
      id
      node
      ... on AddrChanged {
        a
      }
      ... on NameChanged {
        name
      }
      ... on AbiChanged {
        contentType
      }
      ... on PubkeyChanged {
        x
        y
      }
      ... on TextChanged {
        indexedKey
        key
      }
      ... on ContenthashChanged {
        hash
      }
      ... on InterfaceChanged {
        interfaceID
        implementer
      }
    }
  }
  registrations(where: { labelName_not: null }, orderBy: expiryDate, orderDirection: asc, first: 10, skip: 0) {
    expiryDate
    labelName
    domain{
      name
      labelName
    }
  }
}

```
