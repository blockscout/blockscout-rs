# <h1 align="center">Ethereum Bytecode Database</h1>

The Ethereum Bytecode Database is a cross-chain smart contract database 
designed for automatic contract verification. It serves as a proxy between users 
and the [smart-contract-verifier](../smart-contract-verifier) service. 
This verifier stores verified contract data in the database 
and enables searches for contracts with similar bytecodes.

You will recognize the service in action when you see the notification: 
"The contract has been verified using Blockscout Bytecode Database."

### Verifier Alliance (VERA)
The service also interfaces with the 
[Verifier Alliance](https://verifieralliance.org/who.html) database, 
a shared repository of contract source codes from different EVM chains and verification providers.

Blockscout is a data provider for this database, 
and the eth-bytecode-db service writes data into it. 
This database is also used for contract searches.

Note: Currently, you cannot connect to VERA if you run your own eth-bytecode-db instance. 
Only predefined providers with the required credentials have write access. 
If you are a data provider seeking write access, please email join@verifieralliance.org. 
For read access, we plan to open-source the data, 
but direct access to the database from the service will still require credentials.

## Requirements
- Postgresql database
- smart-contract-verifier

## How to enable
Set the following ENVs on blockscout instance:
- `MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_ENABLED=true`
- `MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_URL={service_url}`
- `MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_TYPE=eth_bytecode_db`
- `MICROSERVICE_ETH_BYTECODE_DB_INTERVAL_BETWEEN_LOOKUPS={m}` (optional) -
  minimal time after unsuccessful check of smart contract's sources in Eth Bytecode DB
- `MICROSERVICE_ETH_BYTECODE_DB_MAX_LOOKUPS_CONCURRENCY={}` (optional) -
  maximum amount of concurrent requests for fetching smart contract's sources in Eth Bytecode DB
- `MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_API_KEY={}` (optional) -
  API key for verification that metadata sent to verifier microservice from a trusted source.
  Should correspond to any of `ETH_BYTECODE_DB__AUTHORIZED_KEYS__{name}__KEY` value.
  Used if the service has access to verifier-alliance database.

## Envs
