Tac Operation Lifecycle Service
===

## Intro

[Ton Application Chain](https://docs.tac.build/) (TAC) is an EVM-compatible extension for the TON blockchain.
TAC transactions are ordered and executed under a separate consensus mechanism, with only the execution results being posted back on-chain — a pattern somewhat similar to how rollups operate.

Users interact with TAC either through dedicated dApps or via smart contracts on the TON chain. Regardless of the method, the user’s intention — along with all resulting artifacts — is encapsulated under a single concept called an “Operation.”

These Operations can involve different data flows and a variety of status types. This complexity can be confusing for inexperienced users and may hinder debugging for dApp developers.

This feature addresses that by indexing TAC Operations in a way that provides a clear, high-level overview of what occurred as a result of a user’s action — making it easier for both users and developers to understand at a glance.

## Improvements 

Indexer Logic Description
The TAC Operation Lifecycle Indexer follows a three-stage process:
1. Timeline Dissection:
* The indexer divides the timeline into fixed-size `intervals`
* It maintains a `watermark` that marks the latest processed timestamp
* The `watermark` advances as `intervals` are processed
* For historical data, it processes `intervals` from oldest to newest
For realtime data, it continuously creates new `intervals`
2. Interval Processing:
* For each interval, the indexer fetches a list of operations that occurred within that time window
* Operations are stored in the database with a `pending` status
* The interval is marked as `finalized` once operations are fetched
* If fetching fails, the interval is scheduled for retry with exponential backoff
3. Operation Processing:
* For each operation, the indexer fetches detailed stage information
* Operation stages track the lifecycle of the operation across different blockchains
* Once stages are fetched, the operation is marked as `finalized`
* If fetching fails, the operation is scheduled for retry with exponential backoff

We persist and track latest saved interval (`watermark`) in the database and advance it alongside with creating new intervals.
Apart from latest interval we also track latest `operation` so that if we get a falsely empty response we would automatically request it again.
This PR follows similar practices  from `da_indexer` specifically the server launches multiple future streams:
* historic operation fetcher that selects `intervals` in ascending order from a configurable starting timestamp
* realtime operation fetcher that selects `intervals` in ascending order after the service has started
* failed intervals and operations fetcher resends failed requests with exponential backoff
